  "When you cast this spell, choose a point within range. You teleport to that location and instantly crash to the ground directly beneath that point, accompanied by a flash of lightning. You take no falling damage, but if you land on a creature or a space within 5 feet of a creature, it takes lightning damage equal to the amount of falling damage you would have taken. If you landed on a creature, you immediately move to the nearest open space. If you fell 30 feet or more, you are stunned until the end of your next turn."
